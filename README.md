# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?


# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?


# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?


# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
